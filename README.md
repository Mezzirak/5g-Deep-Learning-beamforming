# 5g-beamforming-project

JUST STARTED 09-09-2025, SO THIS IS AT THE ABSOLUTE BEGINNING RIGHT NOW
ALL OF BELOW IS WHAT IS I HOPE TO EXECUTE IN THIS PROJECT - NOT WHAT IS ALREADY DONE.

I am intending for this project to one day to design, simulate and evaluate a deep learning-based beamformer for adaptive noise cancellation in a 5G multi-user wireless environment. The performance of the neural network model will be benchmarked against a classical Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer.

The core objective is to mitigate two primary forms of interference in modern wireless communications:

1.  **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN):** Fundamental noise inherent in electronic systems.
2.  **Inter-User Interference (IUI):** Signal corruption caused by other users transmitting on the same frequency in a multi-user scenario.

The simulation will compare the effectiveness of a classical Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithm (MVDR) against a deep learning approach in maximising the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for a desired user.
